I have documented few of the interesting trends that I noticed while doing this project:

-On comparing the statistics across years for Illinois, Cook, I see that, the levels of SO2(Sulphur Dioxide) has been decrasing the couple of last 30 years and more or stabilised in the last 5 years. The levels of Carbon Monoxide has been stable for over 10 years now.

-On the other hand, pollutants like PM2.5, Pm10 and Ozone haven't been on a downramp. The levels of PM2.5 was very low in the early days, but have been rising predominantly with a few minor dips along the way. PM10 has seen a surprising spike-like hike around the year 2004. Ozone has also seen a very recent increase.

-On comparing across directions, let's take a few major states such as Florida, California and Illinois and compare the trends.

-The levels of Carbon-monoxide has converged to almost zero in all three states. So has the level of Sulphur dioxide. But sadly, PM2.5 had reached alarming levels.
